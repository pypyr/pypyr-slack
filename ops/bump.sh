# pip install virtualenv
# Usage:
# Run when git working directory clean otherwise it'll error and tell you.
# run like so: ./ops/bump.sh [bumplevel]
# where bumplevel either: major, minor, patch
# if you don't set bumplevel it defaults to patch.
# Don't use me if you've got a dir called .deployenv in $PWD that you want to
# keep.
# if something goes horribly wrong, get rid of git commit and tag like this:
# git reset --hard HEAD~1                        # rollback the commit
# git tag -d `git describe --tags --abbrev=0`    # delete the tag

# default BUMPLEVEL to patch if it doesn't exist.
