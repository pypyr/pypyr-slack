Send messages to [slack](https://slack.com/) from pypyr. This is useful
for sending notifications on success or failure conditions in your automation 
pipelines. Or for sending a message just because you can.

You can send slack message notifications via the cli without writing any code.

[pypyr](https://pypyr.io/) is a cli & api to run pipelines 
defined in yaml.

All documentation for the pypyr slack plugin is here:
